# Abstract Algebra I Notes

These are the notes that I took for Harvey Mudd College's Abstract Algebra I (MATH171) course during the Spring 2017 semester taught by Professor Dagan Karp. Since almost all of these notes were directly copied from what Prof. Karp wrote down on the board during class, I have appropriately named these notes **Scrawlings of the MagiKarp**.

For those of you who can't figure out from looking at the *long* list of files in this repository where the notes are located, they may be found in `abstract.pdf`.
