\section*{Rational Numbers and Bounds}

If $\frac{a}{b},\frac{c}{d}\in\qq$, then
$$\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad+bc}{bd} \hspace{50pt}
\frac{a}{b}-\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad-bc}{bd} \hspace{50pt}
\frac{a}{b}\times\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd} \hspace{50pt}
\frac{a}{b}\div\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad}{bc}$$
provided that $\frac{c}{d}\neq\frac{0}{1}$.\\

\begin{note}
  Strictly speaking, we need to show that these operations are
  \define{well-defined} or that they don't depend on the choice of
  representatives from the equivalence classes.
\end{note}

\begin{defi}
  Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, and $E\subseteq S$. If there exists $\beta\in
  S$ such that $x\leq \beta$ for every $x\in E$, we say $E$ is \define{bounded
  above} and we call $\beta$ an \define{upper bound}. The terms \define{bounded
  below} and \define{lower bound} are defined similarly.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
  Suppose $S$ is an ordered set, $E\subseteq S$, and $E$ is bounded above.
  Suppose there exists $\alpha\in S$ such that $\alpha$ is an upper bound for
  $E$ and if $\gamma<\alpha$, then $\gamma$ is not an upper bound for $E$, then
  $\alpha$ is the \define{least upper bound} of $E$ or the \define{supremum} of
  $E$, and we write $\alpha=\sup{E}$. The \define{greatest lower bound} and
  \define{infimum} ($\inf{E}$) are defined similarly.
\end{defi}

\begin{ex}
  Consider the set $\{r\in\qq:r^2<2\}$, which has no supremum in $\qq$.
\end{ex}

\begin{defi}
  An ordered set $S$ has the \define{least-upper-bound property} if the
  following is true: if $E\subseteq S$, $E$ is not empty, and $E$ is bounded
  above, then $\sup{E}$ exists in $S$.
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}
  If an ordered set has the least-upper-bound property, then it also has the
  greatest-lower-bound property.
\end{prop}

\begin{defi}
  There exists an ordered field $\rr$ (called the \define{real numbers}) which
  has the least-upper-bound property, and it contains an isomorphic copy of
  $\qq$.
\end{defi}

\begin{note}
  Finite ordered fields do not exist. Consider $0\leq1\leq1+1\leq\ldots$ which
  can't be a finite chain.
\end{note}

\section*{Dedekind Cuts}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define the elements of $\rr$ as subsets of $\qq$ called \define{cuts},
    where a cut is a subset $\alpha$ of $\qq$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\alpha$ is a nonempty proper subset of $\qq$ ($\alpha\ne\varnothing$
        and $\alpha\ne\qq$).
      \item If $p\in\alpha$, $q\in\qq$, and $q<p$, then $q\in\alpha$.
      \item If $p\in\alpha$, then $p<r$ for some $r\in\alpha$ (can't be in the
        set and be an upper bound).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Define an order on $\rr$ where $\alpha<\beta$ if and only if $\alpha$
    is a proper subset of $\beta$.
  \item Show that the ordered set $\rr$ has the least-upper-bound property. To
    do this, suppose $A$ is a nonempty subset of $\rr$ that is bounded above.
    Let $\gamma$ be the union of all $\alpha\in A$. Then show $\gamma\in\rr$
    and $\gamma=\sup A$.
  \item For $\alpha,\beta\in\rr$, define the sum $\alpha+\beta$ to be the set
    of all sums $r+s$ where $r\in\alpha$ and $s\in\beta$. Define
    $0^*=\{t\in\qq:t<0\}$ then show axioms for addition in fields hold for
    $\rr$, and that $0^*$ is the additive identity.
  \item Show that if $\alpha,\beta,\gamma\in\rr$ and $\beta<\gamma$, then
    $\alpha+\beta<\alpha+\gamma$. This is part of showing that $\rr$ is an
    ordered field.
  \item For $\alpha,\beta\in\rr$, where $\alpha>0^*$ and $\beta>0^*$, define
    the product $\alpha\beta$ to be $\{p\in\qq:q\le rs,\ r\in\alpha,\
    s\in\beta,\ r>0,\ s>0\}$. Note that $\alpha\beta>0^*$ if $\alpha>0^*$ and
    $\beta>0^*$, which is part of showing that $\rr$ is an ordered field.
  \item Extend the definition of multiplication to all of $\rr$ by setting, for
    all $\alpha,\beta\in\rr$, $\alpha0^*=0^*\alpha=0^*$ and
    $$\alpha\beta=\begin{cases}
      (-\alpha)(-\beta) & \alpha<0^*, \beta<0^*\\
      -[(-\alpha)(\beta)] & \alpha<0^*, \beta>0^*\\
      -[(\alpha)(-\beta)] & \alpha>0^*, \beta<0^*
    \end{cases}$$
    then prove the distributive law.
  \item Associate to each $r\in\qq$ the real number $r^*=\{t\in\qq:t<r\}$ and
    let $\qq^*=\{r^*:r\in\qq\}$. These are the rational cuts in $\rr$.
  \item Show that $\qq$ is isomorphic to $\qq^*$ as ordered fields.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Properties of Real Numbers}

\begin{thm}
  Any two ordered fields with the least upper-bound-property are isomorphic.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  If $x,y\in\rr$, and $x>0$, then there is a positive integer $n$ such that
  $nx>y$. This is called the \define{Archimedean property} of $\rr$.
\end{thm}

\begin{pf}
  Let $A=\{nx:n\in\zz^+\}$ and suppose the Archimedean property is false. Then
  $y$ would be an upper bound of $A$. But then $A$ would have a least upper
  bound. Say $\alpha=\sup A$. Since $x>0$, $\alpha-x<\alpha$, and $\alpha-x$ is
  not an upper bound. Thus, $\alpha-x<mx$ for some $m\in\zz^+$. But then
  $\alpha<(m+1)x$, which contradicts the fact that $\alpha$ is an upper bound
  of $A$. Thus, the Archimedean property must be true.
\end{pf}

\begin{thm}
  If $x,y\in\rr$ and $x<y$, then there exists $p\in\qq$ such that $x<p<y$. We
  say that $\qq$ is \define{dense} in $\rr$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
  For every positive real number $x$ and every positive integer $n$, there is
  exactly one positive real number $y$ such that $y^n=x$.
\end{thm}

\begin{pf}
  There is at most one since $0<y_1<y_2$ implies $y_1^n<y_2^n$. Let
  $E=\{t\in\rr:t>0,t^n<x\}$. Then $E$ is nonempty since
  $t=\frac{x}{1+x}\implies0<t<1\implies t^n<t<x\implies t\in E$. We also know
  $E$ is bounded above since $t>1+x\implies t^n>t>x\implies t\notin E$ and $t$
  is an upper bound. Define $y=\sup E$. We can then show that $y^n<x$ and
  $y^n>x$ each lead to contradictions.
\end{pf}

\begin{ques}
  Given a real number in decimal form, what is its associated Dedekind cut?
\end{ques}

\section*{Cardinality of Sets}

\begin{defi}
  Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. If there is a bijection from $A$ to $B$, then we say
  $A$ and $B$ have the same \define{cardinality} (or `size') and write $A\sim
  B$.  We also write $|A|=|B|$ where $|A|$ denotes the cardinality of $A$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
  Let $\nn$ denote the natural numbers $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$, also denoted
  $\zz^+$. For $n\in\nn$, let $J_n=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ and $J_0=\varnothing$. For
  any set $A$,
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ is \define{finite} if $A\sim J_n$ for some $n\in\nn\cup\{0\}$.
    \item $A$ is \define{infinite} if it is not finite.
    \item $A$ is \define{countable} if $A\sim\nn$.
    \item $A$ is \define{uncountable} if $A$ is neither finite nor countable.
    \item $A$ is \define{at most countable} if $A$ is finite or countable.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}

\begin{note}
  We can put an order on the cardinalities where $|A|\le|B|$ if and only if
  there exists an injection from $A$ to $B$.
\end{note}

\begin{prop}
  Every infinite subset of a countable set is countable.
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}
  Let $\{E_n\}$ where $n\in\zz^+$ be a sequence of countable sets. If
  $S=\cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n$, then $S$ is countable.
\end{prop}

\begin{pf}
  Let the elements of $E_i$ be as follows
  \begin{align*}
    E_1&=\{x_{11},x_{12},x_{13},\ldots\}\\
    E_2&=\{x_{21},x_{22},x_{23},\ldots\}\\
       &\ldots\\
    E_i&=\{x_{i1},x_{i2},x_{i3},\ldots\}\\
       &\ldots
  \end{align*}
  We can traverse these elements diagonally to get
  $S=\{x_{11},x_{21},x_{12},x_{31},x_{22},x_{13},x_{41},\ldots\}$. Since $S$ is
  at most countable and $E_1\subseteq S$ is countable, we have that $S$ is
  countable.
\end{pf}

\begin{prop}
  Let $A$ be a countable set and $B_n$ be the set of all $n$-tuples
  $(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)$ where $a_k\in A$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,n$. Then $B_n$ is
  countable for all $n\in\nn$.
\end{prop}

\begin{thm}
  Let $A$ be the set of all sequences of 0's and 1's. Then $A$ is uncountable.
\end{thm}

\begin{pf}
  Let $E=\{e_1,e_2,\ldots\}$ be a countable subset of $A$. For each $e_i$, we analyze its $i$th digit. We then construct $e\in A$ such that the $i$th digit of $e$ is the opposite of the $i$th digit of $e_i$. For example, if we have
  \begin{align*}
    e_1&=(\boxed{0},1,0,1,1,1,0,1,\ldots)\\
    e_2&=(1,\boxed{1},0,1,0,1,1,0,\ldots)\\
    e_3&=(0,0,\boxed{1},1,0,0,1,1,\ldots)\\
    e_4&=(1,0,1,\boxed{0},1,0,1,1,\ldots)\\
       &\ldots
  \end{align*}
  Then $e=(1,0,0,1,\ldots)$. Since $e\notin E$ but $e\in A$, every countable subset of $A$ is a proper subset of $A$. Thus, $A$ is uncountable.
\end{pf}
